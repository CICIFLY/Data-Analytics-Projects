# Data-Analytics-Projects:

## Certificate : https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/KUM3F4AJ

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Udacity-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree. 

Udacity online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries. 



## Part 1 - Intro to Data Analysis

Subjects Covered:
* Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python
* Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application 
* Data Analysis Process
* NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
* Pandas Series and Dataframes

### Project 1: Explore Weather Trends with weather forecast data 
In this project, I choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.
I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings. 
( It may be better to place this section inside the readme of the project 1) 

### Project 2:  Investigate a dataset called TMDb movie data.
I was provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. I used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report.



## Part 2 -Practical Statistics 

Subjects Covered:
* Probability
* Conditional Probability
* Binominal Distribution
* Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem
* Descriptive Statistics
* Inferential Statistics
* Confidence Levels and Intervals
* Hypothesis Testing
* T-tests and A/B test
* Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression

### Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results with company ab_data.csv 
Using Python, I gathered data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. I documented the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.By using AB Testing and regression methods to decide if the company should launch a new webpage or keep the old one. 



## Part 3 - Data Extraction and Wrangling

Subjects Covered:
* GATHERING DATA: 
   * Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs
   * Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
   * Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database
* ASSESSING DATA 
   * Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
   * Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
   * Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
* CLEANING DATA 
   * Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
   * Clean data using Python and pandas
   * Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Python

### Project 4 :  Data Wrangle and Analyze with Tweet WeRateDogs data
Collect data from different sources and assess data visually and programmatically , clean data for visulizing data and finding insights later. 


## Part 4 - Data Visualisation

Subjects Covered:
* Univariate exploration of data ( histogram , bar charts , Use axis limits and different scales ) 
* Bivariate exploration of data ( scatter plots , clustered bar charts , violin and bar charts , faceting )
* Multivariate exploration of data ( encodings , plot matrices , feature enginnering )
* Explanatory Visulizations ( story telling with data ,  polish plots , create slide deck ) 

### Project 5: Data Visulization with Diamond Data 
Data visualization to a dataset involving the characteristics of diamonds and their prices.

### Project 6: Communicate data finding with Ford Go Bike Sharing Data
In this project, I used Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore the bike dataset for
its properties and relationships between variables. Then, I created a presentation that communicates the findings to others.
