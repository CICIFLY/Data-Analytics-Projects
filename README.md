# Data-Analytics-Projects:
This repository is mainly for projects related to data analytics practice. Most of my Udacity pojects will be uploaded here. 

Udacity online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn
thest basic libraries.
