# What is Fuel Economy?
Excerpt from Wikipedia page on Fuel Economy in Automobiles:
The fuel economy of an automobile is the fuel efficiency relationship between the distance traveled and the amount 
of fuel consumed by the vehicle. Consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance, 
or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed.

# Data set :
Fuel Economy Data
This information is provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory.
Note that the datasets we'll be working with are slightly simpler than those found through the links below.
* EPA Fuel Economy Testing : https://www.epa.gov/compliance-and-fuel-economy-data/data-cars-used-testing-fuel-economy
* DOE Fuel Economy Data : https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml/
For better understanding of the dataset, you can refer the Green Vehicle Guide Documentation and data description.
